## Introduction

Unicorn Companies Analysis is a project aimed at exploring and analyzing private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022, commonly known as "unicorn companies." The analysis will focus on various aspects of these companies, such as their current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns. The main objectives of this analysis are to identify the unicorn companies with the biggest return on investment, understand the time it usually takes for a company to become a unicorn, explore the distribution of unicorns across different countries and identify any industry hubs within specific cities. Additionally, the analysis will also highlight the top investors who have funded the most unicorn companies.
